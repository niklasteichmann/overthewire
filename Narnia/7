[the program loads 2 buffers, does some checking and calls a function fp with one of the buffers]
[one of the checks makes sure that the function is not on the stack, therefor it must be an existing function]
[system() is a good choice, because it just executes the string parameter on the shell]
[the second buffer is not really necessary]
