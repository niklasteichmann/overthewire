[if we try a normal buffer overflow, we will overwrite the pointer that is used to write in the buffer]
[to avoid this, we have to figure out what the value of the pointer is]
[using gdb and ltrace we can find an approximate value]
[the value of the overwritten bytes is output via printf]
[this enables us to check up on the pointer]
[piping the result of printf into hexdump, we can see where the overwriting stopped]
[using this and applying trial-and-error, we can figure out the value of the pointer]
[in the end, we set the value of the return pointer to an env variable filled with NOPs and the shellcode]
