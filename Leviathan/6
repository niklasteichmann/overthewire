[2 ways:]
[ltrace reveals that an atoi takes place]
[1. decompile and look for the code]
[objdump -D leviathan6 | less]
[search for main method]
[look fot atoi call]
[see the next cmp]
[atoi return must be in eax]
[meaning -0xc(%ebp) must be pw]
[see above the movl that moves a constant into this address]
[the constant must be the pw]
[transform hex into decimal]
[pw is 7123!]

[second way is brute force, you can imagine ...]
