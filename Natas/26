[the code uses the function "unserialize"]
[this is a possible entrypoint!]
[because the method doesn't check if the unserialized class is of the given type, we can simply send a serialized Logger]
[the Logger gets a php script as exit message and a file path into the images folder]
[this way, an accessable php script is created]
[see 26_script.py and 26_helper.php]
